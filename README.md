# Usage

#### How the program is organized
There are two class declarations, `Video` and `Movie`. The class `Movie` is a child of the class `Video`. Each movie object is an instance of the class `Movie`. The _movies.py_ file is where I have created the instances and called the function which generates the final webpage.

#### How to generate the webpage
The fresh_tomatoes.py file includes a function called `open_movies_page` which takes in as argument a list of movie instances and generates the final page.
